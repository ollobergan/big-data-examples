# This example shows how to work with hadoop using the pyspark library


Hadoop docker images are from the official image repository
https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/hadoop

I created a my docker image for the pyspark library
https://hub.docker.com/r/ollobergan/pyspark-jupyter

In this example we will learn how to use hadoop using the pyspark library.

Clone the repository and run docker command 
``` docker-compose up -d ```
